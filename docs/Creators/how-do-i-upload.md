# Getting Started as a Creator

Huelet's creator community is a community of people who want to share content with the world.  
To keep the community safe and trustworthy, we require all creators to verify their account further than a basic account. Here's how to do that:

Some of these steps may not be necessary for you, but we've included them all for completeness.

## Step 1: Create an Account

You can create an account on the main Huelet website. At the moment, you will need an alpha code. You can recieve this by joining the [Huelet Discord Server](https://dsc.gg/huelet).
{% info %}
You need to have an active account for more than a week in order to publish content.
{% end %}

## Step 2: Get A Creator Account

Creator accounts are simply an extension of a normal account. You can get a creator account by requesting one on the [Huelet Creator Dashboard](https://dash.huelet.net).

## Step 3: Verify Your Creator Account

At this point, you can publish content on Huelet up to 60 seconds once per week.
You can verify your account at [dash.huelet.net](https://dash.huelet.net/profile/verify). You will need to have a valid email address and/or phone number.
This unlocks the ability to publish content up to 10 minutes on Huelet.
Finally, you can request approval at 1,000 followers. This unlocks the ability to publish content up to one hour.

Confused? Here's a table of the different levels of creator accounts:

| Level    | Duration   | Required Followers |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Creator  | 60 seconds | None!              |
| Human    | 10 minutes | 10                 |
| Approved | 1 hour     | 1,000              |
