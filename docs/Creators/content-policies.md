# Huelet's content policies
Huelet is a community-driven platform for creating and sharing content. We aim to keep a safe and friendly environment for everyone. To keep our platform a safe place for everyone, we have a set of rules and guidelines for content creators and users. A comprehensive list of what is not allowed is written here.

## Violence
Extremely violent content is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to:
 - Human organs and body parts being removed
 - Human death
 - Excessive violence and/or physical harm such as a human being being shot or stabbed multiple times
 - Animal abuse such as a dog being beaten or abused
 - Child abuse such as a child being beaten or abused (further legal action may be taken by Huelet's moderation team)  
  
If our moderation AI detects that a user has violated this rule, your video will be denied. If your video is rated extremely violent, you will not be allowed to appeal it to our human moderation team. Even if your video is not explicitly banned, we may still warn viewers that your video contains violent content.

## Hate content
Hate content is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to:
 - Threats of violence of any kind
 - Extreme toxicity  
  
You may be allowed to appeal this rule to our human moderation team. Even if your video is not banned, we may still warn viewers that your video may contain sensitive content.

## Nudity
Nudity is not allowed. This includes human, animal, and drawn images of nudity. This includes, but is not limited to:
 - Human genitalia
 - Intercourse or masturbation
 - Animal genitalia
 - Hentai  
  
If our moderation AI detects that a user has violated this rule, your video will be denied. Even if your video is not explicitly banned, we may still warn viewers that your video contains suggestive content. If your video is rated extremely nude, you will not be allowed to appeal it to our human moderation team.
## Drugs and alcohol
While content relating to drug use and alcohol use is allowed, we may warn younger viewers if your video contains drugs or alcohol.  
You may **not** suggest to users that they should abuse drugs or alcohol. Your video will be denied if it suggests the abuse of drugs or alcohol.

## Exceptions
Videos from creators such as news channels and blogs **may** post violent content, if it is under the context of informing the viewer of a situation that is very likely to be violent (such as a war, or a natural disaster).

## Other
We reserve the right to remove any content for any reason at any time without notice.
