# About the view counter

The view counter is a simple counter that is incremented every time a user clicks the video to start watching. It is an overcount, so if a user watches the video multiple times, the counter will be incremented multiple times. Creators will have a more accurate view counter by using [Plausible analytics](https://plausible.io/).
